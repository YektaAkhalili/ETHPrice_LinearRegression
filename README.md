# ETHPrice_LinearRegression
Predicting the Price of Ethereum using Linear Regression

This is a project done for an Econometrics class - graduate program of Industrial & Systems engineering. The aim of this project is to predict the price of ETH, which is a cryptocurrency like BitCoin (the most famous one) using Linear Regression. I wrote the code in Python, using a number of modules for analysis. The results of this analysis was, to put it simply, that it's not possible to accurately (or at least, with good enough accuracy and using a correct analysis) predict the price of ETH using Linear Regression. 

Data was obtained from coinmarketcap.com
